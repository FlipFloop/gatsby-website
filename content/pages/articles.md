<h3>Behind the Scenes of ILYMUN: MUN club at the CSI</h3>

<p>A Model UN Club has been held at the Cit√© Scolaire Internationale of Lyon for many years. Students get together every Thursday, after school, to debate various topics, often inspired by ongoing events. Ranging from a motion on measures to protect forests, in light of the Australian bushfires, to resolutions on the refugee crisis, students are brought to confront ideas in a setting imitating a United Nations assembly.<br /><a href="https://medium.com/getting-to-know-ilymun/behind-the-scenes-of-ilymun-mun-club-at-the-csi-f4d202c8248a">See more</a></p>
